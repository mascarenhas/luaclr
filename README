README for LuaCLR 0.1 Alpha

1. What is LuaCLR

LuaCLR is a compiler for the Lua 5.1 language that targets the Microsoft
Common Language Runtime (CLR). Right now it also works on Mono, but
this is not guaranteed in the future. Also, the compiler is not self-hosting,
which means it depends on the Lua interpreter, but as it's implemented in
a mix of Lua and C# it will be completely self-hosted when complete.

The compiler aims for completeness (implementing as much of Lua 5.1, including
the standard library, as possible) and speed (being faster than the Lua VM, and
approaching LuaJIT). Also it should provide transparent interfacing between
Lua and the rest of the CLR (at least as good as what LuaInterface provides).

The current version is incomplete, and lacks most of the Lua standard library,
as well as integration with the rest of the CLR. The design is also not fixed, and
will probably change in the near future.

LuaCLR is free software. The contents of this distribution are Copyright

2. Installation

There is a Makefile for GNU make, so I recommend installing a suite
of GNU tools for Windows. Edit the Makefile to point to where
you store your Lua libraries, and do "make" and "make install".

If you don't have GNU make, and don't want to fiddle with UNIX utilities
see the Makefile for build/installation instructions (it's really easy).

3. Testing

To run a minimal test suite for the parser part type "make test". I will work
on integrating the Lua test suite.

5. Documentation

Please check the doc directory for extra documentation.
